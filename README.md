Hi there
I have included my local database as part of the repo but you dont really need the database to run the solution at all.
The application will create the database and the seed data on startup through migrations
All you need to do is to update the appsetting with your local or remode sql server instants and provide a preferable name for your database.
Then run the solution and you are up and running
